golang implementation of koppeling
Instead of stomping all over the resulting dll, we generate code in go lang so that you can modify whatever exports of the DLL you would like
## Features
- Dump import table of executable
- Dump export table of dll
- Compare tables, match functions, generate go code for DLL hijack opportunities
